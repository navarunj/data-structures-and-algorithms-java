Introduction to Data Structures  
3 min  

* What is a Data Structure?
* It is a structure that organizes and stores data.
* For example, an array is a data structure.
* Each data structure has strengths and weaknesses.
* Arrays are good for random access.
* What data structure should you use? It depends.

Introduction to Algorithms  
4 min

* What is an algorithm?
* It is a process that describes the steps you have to perform to accomplish a specific task.
* For example, an algorithm for making tea might look like this:
    1. Boil water
    2. Add a teabag to a cup
    3. Pour the boiling water into a cup
    .
    .
    .
* This is just ONE algorithm for making tea. 
* There can be more than one algorithm for accomplishing a task.
* It's not unusual for an algorithm to make assumptions.
* An algorithm is not an implementation.
* There can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task.
* There can be many implementations of the same algorithm.
