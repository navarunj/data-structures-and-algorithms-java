Section 2, Video 11  
Introduction to Arrays  
1 min  

* This is not a beginner programming course, so you are probably already familiar with arrays.
* We will do a brief review of how to use an array in Java.
* We will look at how arrays are stored in memory.
* Arrays are good for random access.

Section 2, Video 12  
Big-O Notation  
14 min

* It's useful to compare the performance of one algorithm over another algorithm.
* We could just measure the running time, but that has some issues.
* Hardware is going to influence the running time of algorithms.
* We consider time complexity, which is the number of steps required to run an algorithm.
* We often look at the worst case.
* Example: Adding sugar to tea.
    1. Fetch the bowl containing the sugar
    2. Get a spoon
    3. Scoop out the sugar using the spoon
    4. Pour the sugar from the spoon into the tea
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've added the desired amount of sugar.
